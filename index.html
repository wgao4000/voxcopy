			<h3>Why are people so obsessed with Mars?</h3>
			<p>Mars is the second-closest planet to Earth and, in many ways, the most similar. As long as people have been thinking about space exploration, they've been dreaming of visting Mars. And it now seems possible that a human mission there might actually happen sometime in the next few decades, through a lot hinges on levels of funding to NASA.
			</p>
			<p>Since 1897's War of the Worlds, sci-fi writers have fantasized that Mars was home to intelligent life, partly because 
			</p>
			<p>
			It's unlikely that any life survives on the surface of Mars today: the planet is relatively frigid and has no atmosphere or magnetic field to protect life from the radiation of space. But compared with other options nearby, like Venus and the moon, it remains the most intriguing target for space exploration.
			<p>
			All this is why NASA has been fixated on Mars for decades, putting seven probes in orbit around it and landing another seven on its surface. The technical and medical barriers to sending people to Mars are considerable, and many experts argue that it'd be easier and more fruitful simply to continue sending robotic probes. But NASA hopes to launch a human mission to Mars within the next few decades - and if the agency succeeds, it'd serve as a singular moment in the history of the human species.
